Project-Euler
=============

A showcase of all the problems I have solved on Project Euler

I got introduced to Project Euler by a friend. After checking it out I thought it will be worthwhile doing the problems as Mathematics and Computer Science do complement each other well. 

I hope to be introduced to a variety of mathematic principles which will help me develop efficient solutions to the problems. Also, to use them in the long term in my studies and beyond. 

Here is a link to Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/about

Any further information which I may add will be posted in this section of the README file. Below I will provide the link to the problems and comments about how I got along and any improvements I want to make or have made.
