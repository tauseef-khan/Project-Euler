Project-Euler
=============

A showcase of all the problems I have solved on Project Euler

I got introduced to Project Euler by a friend. After checking it out I thought it will be worthwhile doing the problems as Mathematics and Computer Science do complement each other well. 

I hope to be introduced to a variety of mathematic principles which will help me develop efficient solutions to the problems. Also, to use them in the long term in my studies and beyond. 

Here is a link to Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/about

Any further information which I may add will be posted in this section of the README file. Below I will provide the link to the problems and comments about how I got along and any improvements I want to make or have made.

Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

Link to problem: http://projecteuler.net/problem=1

Comments -

This problem was simple to solve and didn’t take a long time to find the answer (1ms). I can't see how I could improve my solution any further.

Overall, a good problem to get the ball rolling!

Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

Comments -

This problem was again very enjoyable and didn’t take long to solve (2ms). I don’t think I can improve it any further. It already computes the answer pretty fast.

Overall, another problem solved easily.
